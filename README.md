# Scalable Machine Learning in Spark/ Scala
* Slightly adjusted version of scalable machine learning from Mikio Braun.
* Self learning. 
* The src folder includes a test of the LeastSquaresRegression function. 
* This is not very scalable but the results are within reason, and was a useful learning exercise for myself.
